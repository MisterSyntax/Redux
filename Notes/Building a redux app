1. Plan your app by determining Actions, and understanding state
2. create a src folder
    -Place actions in an object in constants.js
    -Place state in initialState.json
3. Nav to where you want to build your project
    - "npm init" //creates your package.json file
4. Install babel and babel command line tool
    npm i babel-cli --save-dev
5. Install latest features of ES6 spec for Babel
    npm i babel-preset-latest --save-dev
6. Install latest experiment features babel-preset-stage-0
    npm i babel-preset-stage-0 --save-dev
7. @ root create .babelrc
    -in here you tell babel what presets to use e.g.
    {"presets" : ["latest", "stage-0"]    }
8. Create your index.js in src
9. In package.json create "start" and "dev" in scripts
    start": "./node_modules/.bin/babel-node ./src/index.js"
    //can omite index.js since its main file in config
10: Test config by running 
    npm start

====
set up constants
1. create a file in /src/ called constants.js
2. this file exports an object with all of the actions that modify state with values of themselves e.g.
    const constants = {
        ADD_DAY: "ADD_DAY",
        REMOVE_DAY: "REMOVE_DAY"
    };

    export default constants;

====
set up reducers
1. create a store folder within /src/ and a reducers.js file in /src/store
2. import constants into reducers.js

==
1. install redux
    -npm i redux --save
2. in reducers.js 
    import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
3. combine reducers to have same form as initialState.json and export them as default
    e.g. 
        {
            reducer1,
            reducer2,
            reducer3,
            nestedReducer: {
                nestedReducer1,
                nestedReducer2
            }
        }
    is
    export default combineReducers({
        reducer1,
        reducer2,
        reducer3,
        nestedReducer: combineReducers({
            nestedReducer1,
            nestedReducer2
        })
    })

====
use combined reducers in your index.js or wherever to mod state
    import C from "./constants";
    import appReducer from "./store/reducers";
    import initialState from "./initialState.json";

    let state = initialState;

    state = appReducer(state, {
        type: "ACTION_NAmE",
        payload: payload_value
    });
