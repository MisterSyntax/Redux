Reducers - pure functions that are desgned to manage specific parts of your state object
Your reducers will need to manage every key in the initialState.json file, and your reducers will be named the same thing as the keys
you want to import your constants into the reducers.js file

export a function for each of your reducers

REDUCER TEMPLATE - don't modify state
import C from "../src/constants"

export const reducerName = (state=defaultVALUE, action) => {
    /**don't need a switch if not multiple actions**/
    switch(){
        case C.ACTION_NAME1 : {
            return newState;
        }
        case C.ADD_TO_STATE : {
            return [
                ...state,
                action.payload
            ];
        }
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
